I'm a third-year PhD student studying neuroscience in Mark Lescroart's [Lab](http://piecesofmind.psyc.unr.edu/) at the University of Nevada, Reno.  My primary current project investigates the way body parts and poses are represented in the brain.  Our findings should be available in pre-print form soon!

My other projects revolve the relationship between cortical processing and artificial neural networks, and how this relationship can be leveraged to better understand both human and artificial intelligence.

I principally code in python, and code for published projects will be available at [my github](https://github.com/MShinkle).
