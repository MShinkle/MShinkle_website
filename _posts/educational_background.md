For my undergrad I attended Cedarville University, studying Psychology with dual emphases on Cognitive Neuroscience and Research and with a minor in Philosophy.  I graduated with a cumulative GPA of 3.89 and a Psychology GPA of 3.98 and was awarded the Robert Abbas Psychology Award, the highest student award offered by the department.  I was also involved in various university capacities including serving as a teaching assistant for General Psychology and Statistics as well as serving in the role of Vice President of the university's Philosopy club.

I'm currently a 1st-year PhD student in the University of Nevada, Reno's [Cognitive and Brain Sciences program](http://groups.unr.edu/unr_psych_cbs/CBS_grad_program/).
