I'm currently a 1st-year PhD student working in Mark Lescroart's [Lab](http://piecesofmind.psyc.unr.edu/) at the University of Nevada, Reno.  We principally use a voxel-wise modeling approach applied to fMRI data to develop encoding models of cortical feature-selectivity in response to naturalistic visual stimuli.  I'm involved in multiple projects, but my main research is currently focused on parsing body-selectivity in occipitotemporal cortex.  In the future I plan to extend this work into encoding models and decoding of representation of other stimulus features, both visually-presented as well as imagined.

My stimuli and analyses are primarily implemented through Python on Linux.  My code can be viewed [here](https://github.com/MShinkle).  I use [pycortex](https://github.com/gallantlab/pycortex) for data visualization and [vm_tools](https://github.com/piecesofmindlab/vm_tools) for regression fits.  WebGL visualizations will be added below as they are presented/published.
