I'm a fourth-year PhD student studying neuroscience in Mark Lescroart's [Lab](http://piecesofmind.psyc.unr.edu/) at the University of Nevada, Reno.  My primary research interest is understanding the similarities and distinctions between deep neural networks and the human brain.  Particularly, I focus on leveraging visualization techniques designed to make neural networks interpretable in order to better understand the functional organization of visual cortex.

My other work includes investigating body- and pose-representation in human lateral-occipital cortex (LOTC).

I'm also involved in designing and running components of the cross-university [Visual Experience Database Project](http://visualexperiencedatabase.org/index.html).

I principally code in Python, but have previous experience with C++, R and MATLAB.  Code for published projects will be available at [my GitHub](https://github.com/MShinkle), and publications and presentations can be found on [my Scholar profile](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=bIcgPiwAAAAJ&hl=en).
