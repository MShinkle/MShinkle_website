For my undergrad I attended Cedarville University, studying Psychology with dual emphases on Cognitive Neuroscience and Research and with minors in Philosophy and Theology.

I'm currently a fourth-year PhD student in the University of Nevada, Reno's [Cognitive and Brain Sciences program](http://groups.unr.edu/unr_psych_cbs/CBS_grad_program/).
