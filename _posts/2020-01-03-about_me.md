I was born and raised in Springfield, Ohio, but now live in Nevada, where the mountains are much higher and the humidity much lower.  My intellectual interests have shifted over time from philosophy to psychology to neuroscience, which I'm studying now.  I really enjoy discussing most topics even marginally related to these areas, but I particularly like hearing unique and diverse perspectives on the role technology can--and should--play in shaping our future.

Outside of academic pursuits I'm interested in film, music (both listening and creating) and carbonating just about anything.
