I'm a third-year PhD student studying neuroscience in Mark Lescroart's [Lab](http://piecesofmind.psyc.unr.edu/) at the University of Nevada, Reno.  My primary current project investigates the way body parts and poses are represented in the brain--our findings should be available in pre-print form soon!

I'm also involved in designing and running the cross-university [Visual Experience Database Project](http://visualexperiencedatabase.org/index.html).

My other projects generally revolve around the relationship between cortical processing and artificial neural networks, as well as how this relationship can be leveraged to better understand both human and artificial intelligences.

I principally code in Python, but have experience with C++, R and MATLAB.  Code for published projects will be available at [my GitHub](https://github.com/MShinkle).
